// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

var myCars = ["Audi","BMW","GTR"];

console.log(`My favorite car is ${myCars[0]}`);
console.log(`I would like to own a ${myCars[1]} car.`);
console.log(`My favorite car for drifting is ${myCars[2]}`);
